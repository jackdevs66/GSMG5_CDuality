## SalPhaseIon + Cosmic Duality — Notes for the patient solver

### Before we begin
To everyone wandering through this maze: take a breath. Puzzles like this are a marathon, not a sprint. If these notes become the last piece you needed, I hope they save you time—and if they do, consider supporting the work that keeps guides like this alive.

### The lay of the land
At the end of the trail, two artifacts matter: `SalPhaseIon.txt` and `cosmic_duality.txt`. One hides words, the other hides meaning. The first gives you seven textual parts; the second is an OpenSSL `Salted__` envelope that won’t open unless the seven are joined the right way.

How the seven parts reveal themselves is consistent with the puzzle’s own language:
- The early hints are mechanical but elegant: sequences of `a`/`b` become ASCII; compact alphabets (a..i with `o`) become decimal, then hex, then text. The outputs read naturally in context.
- The later hints are linguistic: the phrase “our first hint is your last command” resolves to `yourlastcommand`. The odd-looking “shabefanstoo” breaks apart into a familiar theme across the challenge—`sha`—plus a very human hint, “answer too”. Together: a second answer → `secondanswer`.
- Part five looks deceptively open-ended. It isn’t. With parts 1–4 fixed and a small, sensible candidate set for 5–7, only one combination yields valid padding and a stable output.

Once the seven are in place, we do not hash them as one string. Instead, we compute SHA‑256 for each, then XOR those seven digests byte by byte, in order. That 32‑byte result (hex) becomes the OpenSSL password used to derive the AES‑256 key and IV (MD5 `EVP_BytesToKey`, using the included salt).

The seven parts, in order:
1) `matrixsumlist`
2) `enter`
3) `lastwordsbeforearchichoice`
4) `thispassword`
5) `matrixsumlist`
6) `yourlastcommand`
7) `secondanswer`

The derived key (hex):
```
a795de117e472590e572dc193130c763e3fb555ee5db9d34494e156152e50735
```

Decrypting `cosmic_duality.txt` with that key (the blob is base64, begins with `Salted__`, includes an 8‑byte salt) yields a single binary with a fixed fingerprint:
```
SHA-256(cosmic_decrypted.bin) = 4f7a1e4efe4bf6c5581e32505c019657cb7b030e90232d33f011aca6a5e9c081
```
If you get a different hash, you didn’t open the right door.

### Using the tools (kept simple)
These scripts live in `GSMG_Duality/`. The required inputs (`SalPhaseIon.txt`, `cosmic_duality.txt`) should be one directory above.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install pycryptodome`

1) Derive the key and decrypt:
```powershell
python .\GSMG_Duality\solver_salphasion_cosmic.py
```
You’ll see the seven parts, the derived key, and a new file at the project root:
- `cosmic_decrypted.bin`
- its SHA‑256 printed for good measure

2) Verify the output hash:
```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\cosmic_decrypted.bin
# or
certutil -hashfile .\cosmic_decrypted.bin SHA256
```
Expect:
```
4f7a1e4efe4bf6c5581e32505c019657cb7b030e90232d33f011aca6a5e9c081
```

3) (Optional) Prove uniqueness within a reasonable space:
```powershell
python .\GSMG_Duality\validate_uniqueness.py
```
It walks a compact candidate set for parts 5–7 and confirms there’s exactly one valid decryption with the expected hash.

### Closing thoughts
Puzzles are conversations: between the author and the solver, but also between the methods we bring and the patience we keep. If this write‑up helped you move with a steadier step, that’s the outcome it was designed for. And if you can, supporting it helps keep the lights on for the next traveler.
